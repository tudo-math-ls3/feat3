The 'feat3_logo_master.svg' is the actual master logo file, which was designed as a vector graphics file in Inkscape.
This file should be used to export the logo to new file formats and/or resolutions if none of the existing other files
are an option for u. Please do not overwrite or distribute this master file.

The 'feat3_logo.pdf' contains the logo as a vector graphics in PDF format. This is the recommended logo file that can
easily be embedded into LaTeX documents.

If you require a rasterized version of the logo instead of a vector graphics version, please consider one of the
'feat3_logo_xxx.png' files and choose a file of appropriate size for your use case.
