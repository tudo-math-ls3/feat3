// \brief FEAT Tutorial 07: Stokes solver (TM)
//
// This file contains a simple Stokes solver for a parabolic Poiseuille-Flow on the
// unit-square domain.
//
// The PDE to be solved reads:
//
//    -Laplace(v) + Gradient(P) = 0         in the domain [0,1]x[0,1]
//        -Div(v)               = 0
//
// with pure Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity on the whole boundary
// as well as vanishing pressure integral mean.
//
// The analytical velocity field v = (v_1, v_2) is given as
//
//         v_1(x,y) = 4*y*(1 - y)
//         v_2(x,y) = 0
//
// The analytical pressure is given as
//
//           p(x,y) = 4 - 8*x
//
//
// The main purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate the type definitions and usage of
// "meta-containers", i.e. "vectors of vectors" and "matrices of matrices". In contrast to
// some other finite element software packages, we do not assemble "block operators" of
// PDE systems into a single scalar CSR matrix, but instead build "meta-matrices", which
// allow us to work the combined PDE operator as a whole or by using its parts separately.
//
// The program flow of this application roughly coincides to the one from Tutorial 01 (as far
// as Poisson and Stokes can coincide, that is).

  // Our data arrays should be double precision.

  // Use the default index type for indexing.
  typedef Index IndexType;

  // At this point, we want to define the vector type(s) that we want to use.
  // In contrast to all previous tutorials, which were scalar PDEs, we are now dealing with
  // a system of PDEs and therefore with more than one vector component. More precisely, our
  // desired solution vector is composed of a vector field for the velocity and a scalar
  // function for the pressure. In this case, we require several (different) vector types,
  // which we have to define here.

  // For vector fields, there is a specialized vector class available, namely the DenseVectorBlocked.
  // In addition to the usual Data-Index type duo, which we have already used before,
  // we also have to specify the dimension of the vector field as the fourth template parameter.
  typedef LAFEM::DenseVectorBlocked<DataType, IndexType, dim> VectorVeloType;

  // Next, we need the vector type for the pressure, which is a scalar function, so we can
  // use the already well-known DenseVector here:
  typedef LAFEM::DenseVector<DataType, IndexType> VectorPresType;

  // Finally, we need to "concatenate" the velocity and pressure vector types to one so-called
  // "meta-vector" type. A "meta-vector" is, generally speaking, a "vector of vectors".
  // There are two class templates which can be used to define such meta-vectors and the one
  // that we will be using here is the "TupleVector", which can concatenate two (or more)
  // vectors of an arbitrary vector type, as long as the Data-Index type duos are
  // the same. We call this new type the "system vector type", indicating that this vector
  // type contains all the sub-vector of our full PDE system, which is the velocity-pressure
  // vector pair in this case.
  typedef LAFEM::TupleVector<VectorVeloType, VectorPresType> SystemVectorType;


  // Okay, we have all the required vector types. Now, we need to define the matrix types.

  // The Stokes operator consists of several terms, which correspond to different test-/trial-
  // space pair combinations, namely:

  //      Operator   Matrix  Trial      Test
  //   -Laplace(u) : A       velocity / velocity
  //       Grad(p) : B       pressure / velocity
  //        Div(u) : D       velocity / pressure

  // So in summary, we have the well-known "saddle-point" structure of the system:
  //
  //       [ A  B ] * [ v ] = [ f ]
  //       [ D  0 ]   [ p ]   [ 0 ]

  // As the velocity is a vector field and the pressure is a scalar, we will be dealing with
  // 'blocked' matrices instead of 'scalar' ones as in the previous tutorials.
  // The corresponding matrix type is the 'SparseMatrixBCSR' (note the 'B'), and it expects
  // the dimensions of the blocks as the two additional template parameters:
  typedef LAFEM::SparseMatrixBCSR<DataType, IndexType, dim, dim> MatrixTypeA;
  typedef LAFEM::SparseMatrixBCSR<DataType, IndexType, dim,   1> MatrixTypeB;
  typedef LAFEM::SparseMatrixBCSR<DataType, IndexType,   1, dim> MatrixTypeD;

  // Finally, we have to build the 'full matrix', which is a saddle-point matrix consisting
  // of the three above defined matrix blocks.
  typedef LAFEM::SaddlePointMatrix<MatrixTypeA, MatrixTypeB, MatrixTypeD> SystemMatrixType;

  // That's it for the matrix type. Note that although we are dealing with more complex
  // matrix and vector types here, these types still share some of the basic functionality
  // of the simple containers that we have been using before. For example, we can still
  // create compatible vectors by calling the matrix's "create_vector_l/r" functions or
  // format vectors by calling their "format" function.


  // As the last step, we have to define the boundary condition filters for both the
  // velocity and pressure spaces. This is quite similar to the definition of the vector
  // type above, i.e. we first choose the filters for the velocity and pressure spaces and
  // then "concatenate" them by using a "tuple" container.

  // For the velocity, we prescribe in-/out-/no-flow boundary conditions -- or in other
  // word: Dirichlet boundary conditions on the whole boundary. Now since the velocity is
  // a vector field and not a scalar function, we now also require a "blocked" version of
  // the unit-filter, which is the "UnitFilterBlocked":
  typedef LAFEM::UnitFilterBlocked<DataType, IndexType, dim> FilterVeloType;

  // As there is no Neumann boundary region for the velocity, the pressure is only defined
  // up to an additive constant (update your Stokes solution theory knowledge if this is
  // not clear to you), so we need to fix that. One elegant possibility to circumvent this
  // problem is to enforce that the pressure will have a mean value of zero. For this, we
  // employ a "MeanFilter", which is defined as follows:
  typedef LAFEM::MeanFilter<DataType, IndexType> FilterPresType;

  // Now in analogy to the vector types, we need to combine the velocity and pressure filters
  // by concatenating them with a "TupleFilter":
  typedef LAFEM::TupleFilter<FilterVeloType, FilterPresType> SystemFilterType;

  // Okay, that's it for the typedef orgy ;)

    // We have Dirichlet boundary conditions for the velocity, so we first require a unit-filter
    // assembler:
    Assembly::UnitFilterAssembler<MeshType> unit_asm;

    // As usual, add the whole boundary to the assembler:

    // Now we need to chose the boundary condition function. We want to have a parabolic profile

      1.0  // v-max
    );

    // We can now assemble the unit-filter for the velocity component of the system filter.
    // As the system filter is a TupleFilter, we can access its first (i.e. velocity) component

    // As usual, apply the filter onto the initial solution and right-hand-side vectors:

    // Moreover, we also want to filter the system matrix, just as we did in all previous
    // tutorials (except for tutorial 06). Unfortunately, this is not as easy as previously,
    // because the TupleFilter has no "filter_mat" function -- and this is for a reason.

    // The problem is that there is no general rule on whether and, if so, how filters have
    // to be applied on matrices. This gets even more complicated when you are dealing with
    // systems of PDEs with different (possibly chained) filters for the various components.

    // In this tutorial, we are dealing with a unit-filter/mean-filter pair for a Stokes system.
    // In this case, we have to apply the 'filter_mat' function of the velocity unit-filter
    // into the "A" sub-matrix (in analogy to the previous tutorials):
    filter.at<0>().filter_mat(matrix.block_a());

    // Moreover, we have also have to apply the unit-filter onto the sub-matrix "B", this
    // time calling the "filter_offdiag_row_mat" function to zero our all rows of B, which
    // correspond to test function DOFs affected by Dirichlet boundary conditions:
    filter.at<0>().filter_offdiag_row_mat(matrix.block_b());

    // The mean-filter component of the pressure does not provide a means to filter matrices,
    // thus the "D" sub-matrix remains unfiltered -- this is, by the way, the reason why the
    // commonly (i.e. in literature) used identity "D = B^T" is not really correct from a
    // practical point of view.

    // Solver set-up

    std::cout << "Solving linear system...\n";

    // We have to set up a linear solver now. As we a dealing with a non-scalar system of the form
    // of a saddle-point system here, our choice of solvers and preconditioners is significantly
    // reduced, as we can only pick solvers which...
    // 1) work for any type of matrix structure (aka "black-box" solvers) or
    // 2) are special solvers for saddle-point systems.

    // The solvers that fall into category 1) are the simple Richardson iteration, any sort
    // of Multigrid as well as all Krylov subspace solvers (PCG, PCR, FMGRES, BiCGStab).

    // Category 2) currently boils down to the "Schur-complement" preconditioner, which splits the
    // saddle-point system into two separate systems, as well as the monolithic "Vanka", which is
    // a sophisticated Block-Gauss-Seidel/Jacobi method that is often used as a multigrid smoother.

    // In this tutorial, we want to keep it as simple as possible, so we stick to a FMGRES(64)
    // solver with a Vanka preconditioner. We could also try BiCGStab as an outer solver, but this
    // one would only work for very small levels, as the solver is simply too "weak" for this
    // type of problem :(

    // So, let us first create a Vanka preconditioner. The first two arguments are the saddle-point
    // system matrix and the system filter. The third mandatory argument is the desired variant of
    // the Vanka, which is represented by the "Solver::VankaType" enumeration. In total, there are
    // eight different Vanka variants available and (unfortunately) it requires some background
    // knowledge and experience to choose a suitable variant for a given problem. In our case, namely
    // a Stokes system with a Q2/P1dc discretization, the "blocked full multiplicative" variant will
    // do just fine, as long as we apply some under-relaxation of, say, 0.8:
    auto vanka = Solver::new_vanka(
      matrix,                             // the system matrix
      filter,                             // the system filter
      Solver::VankaType::block_full_mult, // the desired Vanka variant
      0.8                                 // the relaxation parameter
    );

    // Next, we can create a GMRES(64) solver and use the Vanka as a preconditioner.
    // In contrast to PCG and BiCGStab, the GMRES solver requires a few additional parameters:
    auto solver = Solver::new_gmres(
      matrix, // the system matrix
      filter, // the system filter
      64,     // the Krylov subspace dimension
      0.0,    // inner pseudo-residual scale factor
      vanka   // the preconditioner
    );

    // Set the plot mode of the solver:
    solver->set_plot_mode(Solver::PlotMode::all);

    // As FGMRES-Vanka is not a really powerful solver configuration, we have to increase the
    // maximum number of allowed iterations. 1000 should be sufficient for up to level 6:
    solver->set_max_iter(1000);

    // Also, reduce the required tolerance to 10^{-5} to speed things up a bit:
    solver->set_tol_rel(1E-5);

    // Okay, our solver is set up, so initialize it now:

    // pass the pressure component of the solution vector to the 'add_scalar_cell' function, but we
    // need to project it onto the cells before. This works quite similar to the "vertex projection"
    // that has been demonstrated in the previous tutorials:

      cell_pres,                // the vector that receives the cell-projection of the pressure

      space_pres,               // the pressure space
      cubature_name             // the cubature rule for the projection.
    );

    // Now we can add the cell-projected pressure to our VTK exporter:
    exporter.add_cell_scalar("pressure", cell_pres.elements());
