     * \brief Global Matrix wrapper class template
     *
     * This class implements a wrapper that contains a LAFEM matrix as its core data object and
     * provides the necessary synchronization functions required in an MPI-parallel simulation
     * based on the overlapping domain decomposition approach. Effectively, this class only
     * couples a local LAFEM matrix with its corresponding pair of row/column Global::Gate objects,
     * which are required to define the compatible L/R vector types, which then take care of the
     * actual synchronization dirty work.
     *
     * \tparam LocalVector_
     * The type of the local matrix container; may be any valid combination of LAFEM (meta-)matrix types
     *
     * \tparam RowMirror_
     * The type of the row mirror; must be compatible to the L-vector type of the local matrix
     *
     * \tparam ColMirror_
     * The type of the column mirror; must be compatible to the R-vector type of the local matrix

       * the matrix counterpart of the type-0 synchronization of a vector, i.e. all matrix entries,
       * which are shared by multiple processes, are replaced by the sum of all contributions from

       *
       * \attention
       * The resulting matrix may (and usually will) have a larger stencil than the original underlying
       * patch-local LAFEM matrix, which is stored in this object's _matrix variable. The reason is that
       * a neighbor process may have additional couplings between DOFs that this process does not have,
       * and these additional coupling are also included in this process's type-1 matrix. However, the
       * stencil of the returned matrix is never smaller than the original local matrix stencil, i.e.
       * the stencil of the patch-local type-0 matrix is always a sub-stencil of the returned type-1
       * matrix.
       *
       * \returns
       * A new local matrix object containing the type-1 matrix for this process patch.
