     * \brief Global vector wrapper class template
     *
     * This class implements a wrapper that contains a LAFEM vector as its core data object and
     * provides the necessary synchronization functions required in an MPI-parallel simulation
     * based on the overlapping domain decomposition approach. Effectively, this class only
     * couples a local LAFEM vector with its corresponding Global::Gate, which actually performs
     * all the dirty MPI work.
     *
     * This wrapper class implements all the 'black-box' functionality of a LAFEM vector and
     * includes the required synchronization for each operation. In the end, the only operations
     * which require direct synchronization/communication are the dot-product and all types of
     * norm functions. Most other functions (such as axpy, copy or scale) are parallel by nature
     * and do not require any type of synchronization, however, they should still be called on
     * all processes for the sake of consistency, unless a purely patch-local modification of
     * the vector is desired, of course.
     *
     * The class provides the two explicit synchronization functions sync_0() and synch_1(),
     * which synchronize the vector data between nearest neighbors in the overlapping domain
     * decomposition approach, thus ensuring that after all call to one of these functions,
     * each DOF, which is shared by more than one process, has the same value on each if these
     * processes, thus ensuring consistency of the DOF values across all processes.
     * The difference between these two function is as follows:
     * Each DOF, which is shared by more than one process, ...
     * - sync_0: ... is replaced by the \b sum of all its contributions from each process that
     *           shares this DOF.
     * - sync_1: ... is replaced by the \b average of all its contributions from each process that
     *           shares this DOF.
     *
     * The 'sync_0' function is used after each assembly of a dual (right-hand-side or defect)
     * vector to sum up all the linearform contributions for each DOF among all processes. This
     * function is also used to synchronize a dual vector after a matrix-vector multiplication.
     *
     * The 'sync_1' function is used whenever the local vectors are inconsistent over the processes,
     * e.g. after applying a patch-local preconditioner, by averaging each DOF over all processes
     * that contribute to that DOF.
     *
     * Finally, this class also offers a function named 'from_1_to_0', which effectively scales
     * each DOF by 1/K, where K is the number of processes that share the corresponding DOF. With
     * this function, a call to 'sync_1' is effectively equivalent to a call to 'from_1_to_0'
     * followed by a call to 'sync_0'.
     *
