  /**
   * \brief Distributed File Input/Output class
   *
   * This class implements various static functions for reading and writing files in
   * text or binary mode in a distributed (i.e. parallel) build.
   *
   * There are three basic sets of functions for reading files as well as a combined version:
   * - #read_common: one process reads a single text or binary file and broadcasts its
   *   contents to all other processes
   * - #read_sequence: each process reads a single text or binary file, which is indexed
   *   by the process rank
   * - #read_ordered: all processes read from a single common binary file, ordered by ranks,
   *   and using the official MPI I/O routines
   * - #read_combined: all processes read from a single common binary file which contains
   *   a common data block, which is read by all processes, as well as a private data block,
   *   that is read by each process individually using a combination of the official
   *   MPI I/O routines. See the corresponding remarks section below for details.
   *
   * Moreover, there are two sets of functions for writing files:
   * - #write_sequence: each process writes a single text or binary file, which is indexed
   *   by the process rank
   * - #write_ordered: all processes write into a single common binary file, ordered by ranks,
   *   and using the official MPI I/O routines
   * - #write_combined: all processes write into a single common binary file, which contains
   *   a common data block as well as a private data block, that is written by each process
   *   ordered by ranks using a combination of the official MPI I/O routines.
   *   See the corresponding remarks section below for details.
   *
   * Each common/sequence function comes in two overloads: one for objects of type std::stringstream
   * for text files  and another one for objects of type BinaryStream for binary files.
   *
   * <b>Remarks regarding Sequence I/O functions:</b>\n
   * For both the read_sequence and write_sequence functions, one specifies a filename pattern
   * which is used as a template for the generation of the filename for each rank.
   * The filename pattern has to contain a continuous block of asterisks (*), which serves as
   * a place-holder for the 0-padded rank number.
   *
   * <b>Example:</b>\n
   * If pattern is <c>./my_file_****.txt</c>, then
   * - rank 0 reads/writes the file <c>./my_file_0000.txt</c>
   * - rank 1 reads/writes the file <c>./my_file_0001.txt</c>
   * - rank 2 reads/writes the file <c>./my_file_0002.txt</c>
   * - etc.
   *
   * <b>Remarks regarding Combined I/O functions:</b>\n
   * In contrast to the  #write_ordered() functions also offered by this class, the
   * #write_combined() function does not simply write out the raw data arrays to the file,
   * but it also writes out a simple file header including all the required array size
   * informations for each data array. In consequence, when reading in a file using the
   * #read_combined() function, it is not necessary to allocate the output buffer for each
   * process beforehand (as opposed to the #read_ordered() function) because the required
   * buffer size is automatically read from file.
   *
   * In addition to that, the combined data file can also contain a \e common data array,
   * which is automatically broadcasted to all processes by the #read_combined() function
   * upon reading. This common data array can be used to store information that is
   * identical for all processes and therefore does not need to be stored by each process
   * individually to reduce redundancy within the file and therefore reduce the total
   * file size. When calling the #write_combined() function, the caller can decide which
   * process (called "root") is responsible for writing out the common data array.
   *
   * The binary output file is composed of four sections or chunks:
     \verbatim
       +---+---+---+---+
       | H | S | C | P |
       +---+---+---+---+
     \endverbatim
   * - 'H': a 32-byte file header which consists of four \c uint64 entries:
   *   - the file magic, which must be equal to #magic_combined = <c>"FEAT3CDF"</c>
   *   - the total filesize in bytes
   *   - the number of processes that were used to write the file
   *   - the size of the common buffer in bytes
   * - 'S': an \c uint64 array which contains the sizes of the process data arrays in bytes
   * - 'C': the raw common data array, may be empty
   * - 'P': the data arrays from each process, ordered by ranks
   *
   * Assume we have (n+1) processes and each process has an identical copy of a common data
   * array \c C of size <c>SC := sizeof(C)</c> bytes as well as a private data array <c>Pk</c>
   * of size <c>Sk := sizeof(Pk)</c> bytes:
     \verbatim
      +--------+   +--------+   +--------+       +--------+
      | Rank 0 |   | Rank 1 |   | Rank 2 |       | Rank n |
      | C | P0 |   | C | P1 |   | C | P2 |  ...  | C | Pn |
      +--------+   +--------+   +--------+       +--------+
       \_/ \__/     \_/ \__/     \_/ \__/         \_/ \__/
       SC   S0      SC   S1      SC   S2          SC   Sn
        bytes        bytes        bytes            bytes
     \endverbatim
   * The corresponding binary output file created by the #write_combined() function will have
   * a total fizesize of <c>32 + 8*(n+1) + SC + S0 + S1 + S2 + ... + Sn</c> bytes:
     \verbatim
      +--------+-----------------+----------+----------+----------+-----+----------+
      | Header | S0 S1 S2 ... Sn |    C     |    P0    |    P1    | ... |    Pn    |
      +--------+-----------------+----------+----------+----------+-----+----------+
       \______/ \_______________/ \________/ \________/ \________/       \________/
       32 bytes   8*(n+1) bytes    SC bytes   S0 bytes   S1 bytes   ...   Sn bytes
