  /**
   * \brief Thread fence synchronization utility class
   *
   * This class implements a "fence" for manual thread synchronization,
   * which is characterized by the following properties:
   * - The fence can be either open or closed.
   * - If the fence is closed, any thread calling the 'wait' function
   *   will block until some other thread opens the fence.
   * - If the fence is open, any thread calling the 'wait' function
   *   will return immediately without blocking.
   * - Any thread can open the fence by calling the 'open' function,
   *   which also notifies and unblocks all waiting threads.
   *
   * In addition to the above properties, this class also stores an
   * additional internal boolean state variable, which is specified by
   * the open() function and is returned by the wait() function.
   *
